<div>
    If a wildcard ('*') resolves to a version in the source pattern and 
    would resolve multiple versions only the highest version would get downloaded.
    E.g assume two artifacts:<br/>
    path_to_version/2.0/dir/a.ext<br/>
    path_to_version/2.1/dir/a.ext<br/>
    and a resolve pattern of<br/>
    path_to_version/*/dir/**<br/>
    then only the 2.1 version would get downloaded.<br/>
    <b>Note:</b> only the first wildcard is tested against a version
